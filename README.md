NLP_Project_Analysing_Text

For this project, you will be analyzing text message data using Natural Language Processing techniques and libraries.

You are free to use the dataset that is provided or collect your own SMS data from a service like WhatsApp or just from your device’s messaging default app.

You will be diving deeper into NLP skills in order to gain a better understanding of the insights chat data can offer.

Project Objectives:
Work locally on your own computer.
Import and look over your dataset.
Conduct text-preprocessing.
Plan and conduct any number of NLP techniques to analyze and gain insight into the data.


These techniques can include:

Language Parsing
Word Vectorization
Language Modeling
Topic Modeling
Checking Similarity
Sentiment Analysis
POS Tagging
Named Entity Recognition
Optional Objectives
Document, organize, and share your findings.
Make predictions about a dataset’s features based on your findings.

Dataset I'm used: 

While there are many ways to procure text message data, here we have chosen the The National University of Singapore SMS Corpus dataset, made publicly available by The National University of Singapore. This dataset contains 67,093 text messages (SMSs) taken from the corpus on Mar 9, 2015 and is mostly comprised of messages from Singaporeans and students attending the University.

This corpus was collected by Tao Chen and Min-Yen Kan:
